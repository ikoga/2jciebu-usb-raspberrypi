# 2jciebu-usb-raspberrypi
It is a sample program for evaluating Omron's sensor 2JCIE-BU with Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.  

2JCIE-BU is a multifunction sensor module that can be used for sensing various environmental information.  
Various sensors such as temperature, humidity, light, barometric pressure, noise, 3 axis acceleration, etc. are equipped.  
Earthquakes can be judged based on highly accurate vibration acceleration.  
We utilize a volatile organic compound (VOC GAS) sensor to realize continuous monitoring of indoor air quality.  
USB and Bluetooth® are provided as interfaces.

## Description
- sample_2jciebu.py  
It is a sample program that can acquire sensing data with the USB serial interface and check it on the console.  
The LED lights up while data is being acquired.

***DEMO:***  
When you run sample_2jciebu.py, you can see the sensing data on console.

## Installation
1. It is necessary to install dependency software beforehand.  
    [Dependencies](#link)
2. Open Terminal and execute the following command.    
    ```
    $ mkdir omron_sensor
    $ cd omron_sensor
    $ git clone https://github.com/omron-devhub/2jciebu-usb-raspberrypi.git
    ```

## Usage

Procedure to operate the sample program. Open Terminal and execute the following commands.

### Install FTDI driver

To communicate with 2JCIE-BU via serial interface, you need to install FTDI driver and register the sensor.

```
$ sudo modprobe ftdi_sio
$ sudo chmod 777 /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio/new_id
$ sudo echo 0590 00d4 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio/new_id
```

If you wish to load driver automatically every boot. Add the following line to `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-ftdi.rules`.

```
ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0590", ATTRS{idProduct}=="00d4", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe ftdi_sio" RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo 0590 00d4 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio/new_id'"
```

### Run sample program

Run `sample_2jciebu.py`.

```
$ sudo python3 sample_2jciebu.py
```

To stop, press Ctrl + C.
